CODE CHALLENGE.
This repository contains three toy problems in JavaScript that aim to help beginner programmers practice their skills.These iclude:

1.Student Grade Generator
The first problem is a program that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade based on the input:

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

2.Speed Detector
The second problem is a program that takes as input the speed of a car and prints "Ok" if the speed is less than 70. If the speed is higher, the program calculates the number of demerit points for the driver based on the criteria:

For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program prints: "License suspended".

3.Net Salary Calculator
The third problem is a program that calculates an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
